## About Me
*(Contains styled text, a table & a relative link(image))*

Hi, my name is Sally Lei! :smile: I'm a second-year student at UCSD in Warren majoring in Computer Science. I chose to major in CS because I like the feeling of accomplishment when my code succeeds at carrying out its intended task.

### Quotes
*(Contains quoted text and quoted code)*

My favorite quote is:
>You canâ€™t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.

It's from a book titled *When Breath Becomes Air* by Paul Kalanithi.


My favorite programming language is Java. To print the line "Hello World" to the console using Java, the following would be typed:
```
System.out.println("Hello World");
```
