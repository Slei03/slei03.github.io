# About Me
Hi, my name is Sally Lei! I'm a second-year student at UCSD in Warren majoring in Computer Science. I chose to major in CS because I like the feeling of accomplishment when my code succeeds at carrying out its intended task. 


**Note:** Programming is ~~not~~ *stressful*.   **It _really_ is ~~not~~.** ***Stressful.***

## Quotes
My favorite quote is:
>You canâ€™t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.

It's from a book titled *When Breath Becomes Air* by Paul Kalanithi.


My favorite programming language is Java. To print the line "Hello World" to the console using Java, the following would be typed:
```
System.out.println("Hello World");
```
